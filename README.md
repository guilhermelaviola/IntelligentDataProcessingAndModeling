# IntelligentDataProcessingAndModeling
My school homework from **#DescomplicaDigital** on Data Science &amp; Cybersecurity 3.1.2 - Intelligent Data Processing & Modeling, which uses AI, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing to automate extracting, understanding, and transforming complex, unstructured data (like documents, emails, images) into structured, actionable insights for smarter business decisions, moving beyond basic OCR to interpret, classify, and even summarize information for improved efficiency and accuracy. It involves capturing data, analyzing it, classifying documents, extracting key details, validating, and integrating it into workflows for tasks like invoice processing, financial analysis, or customer service.
